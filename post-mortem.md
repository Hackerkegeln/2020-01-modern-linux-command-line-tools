# Post mortem

## Practice live coding with audience in mind

- try to clear the screen more often, so that the cursor is at the top of the screen. People sitting
  in the back of the room might have trouble seeing what you are typing when the cursor is always at
  the bottom row of the terminal.

### Try to integrate `alwaysontop` script when demoing shell stuff

- https://github.com/swirepe/alwaysontop
- does not work within tmux / byobu :-(
